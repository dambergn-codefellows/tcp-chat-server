- [X]Each client instance should be started on an individual thread using the threading module in Python
- [X]Clients should be able to send messages to all other clients by sending it to the server without a special command
- [ ]Clients should be able to run special commands by sending messages that start with a command name, for example:
  - [ ]The client should send @quit to disconnect (this should not stop the serverâ€¦ only the client that invoked @quit)
  - [X]The client should send @list to list all connectued users

- [ ]Connected clients should be maintained as an in memory collection on the server instance called the client_pool
- [X]When a socket emits the close event, the socket should be removed from the client_pool
- [?]When a socket emits the data event, the data should be logged on the server and the commands below should be implemented
